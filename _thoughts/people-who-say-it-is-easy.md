There are two kinds of people who say "what's the big deal? It's easy! just do it right".

One, are those professionals who are genuinely good at what they do.
They have spent years honing their craft, and they can do it in their sleep.
They are the ones who can make it look easy because they have put in the time and effort to master it.
They are the ones who can help you learn and grow;
but they are also the ones who can be frustrating to work with;
because they can feel like being dissmissive of your struggles.
When/if you say "I don't get how it's easy", they would just take a step aside, and implement it for you.

Second kind of people say it is easy but will never do it themselves.
They are assholes.
